### A Scientific Perspective on Religion through the Schizoid Process

This repository hosts the academic paper titled **"Consciousness, Dream, and Evolution: A Scientific Perspective on Religion through the Schizoid Process"** by **Sedat B端y端k**.

## Abstract

This paper proposes a novel hypothesis on the origin of religious experiences, arguing that religion emerged as a symbolic reflection of schizoid psychological processes. The study draws from the author's self-induced long-term schizoid phase and analyzes it through scientific observation. It emphasizes the role of dreams, symbolism, and internal transformation in shaping religious myths, and presents a framework where religion can be interpreted not as divine revelation but as a misunderstood evolutionary phase of consciousness.
